# less

`less` is the opposite of `more`. `less` allows you to page forward (and
backward) in a file without needing to load the entire file before
starting, important in working with large files. It uses `vi` commands
to search and page through the file.

# Challenges

* Display the contents of `demo/henry5.txt`

#TODO
* Need a longer file to page through
